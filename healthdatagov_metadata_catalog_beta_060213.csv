<p>Household Component Summary Tables
</p>
<p>The Household Component summary tables provide frequently used summary estimates at the national level on household medical utilization and expenditures: demographic characteristics, health conditions, health status, use of medical care services, charges and payments, access to care, satisfaction with care, health insurance coverage, income, and employment. Some of these tables can be customized online. State-level estimates of household medical utilization and expenditures are also provided for selected states. 
   Insurance Component Summary Tables 
</p>
<p>The Insurance Component summary tables provide estimates at the national, state, and metro area levels on employer-based health insurance: number and types of insurance plans, premiums, benefits, contributions by employers and employees, and employer characteristics. 
   Please note, in preparation for improvements in the data collection process, 2007 data for the Insurance Component was not collected.

<p>MEPS employer-based health insurance tables are produced in the year following data collection. Private-sector tables are posted in July; government and civilian tables are posted in November.
   National-level tables: Private sector estimates by firm size, industry group, census regions and other characteristics; public sector data by state and local government types, government size, and census division; civilian estimates that incorporate both the private and state and local government sectors; national totals for enrollees and cost of health insurance coverage for both the private and public sectors. 
   State and metro area tables: State-level estimates for the private sector by firm size, industry groupings, ownership type, age of firm, employee characteristics, and average wage quartiles. Metropolitan area private sector estimates of premiums, employee contributions, enrollments, and take-up rates by firm size.

Based on evidence-based practices, this program is a smoking cessation intervention for smokers who are ready to quit smoking. Although evidence supports the use of text messaging as a platform to deliver cessation interventions, it is expected that the maximum effect of the program will be demonstrated when it is integrated into other elements of a national tobacco control strategy.  The QuitNowTXT program is designed to deliver tips, motivation, encouragement and fact-based information via unidirectional and interactive bidirectional message formats. The core of the program consists of messages sent to the user based on a scheduled quit day identified by the user. Messages are sent for up to four weeks pre-quit date and up to six weeks post quit date. Messages assessing mood, craving, and smoking status are also sent at various intervals, and the user receives messages back based on the response they have submitted. In addition, users can request assistance in dealing with craving, stress/mood, and responding to slips/relapses by texting specific key words to the QuitNow. Rotating automated messages are then returned to the user based on the keyword. Details of the program are provided below. Texting STOP to the service discontinues further texts being sent.  This option is provided every few messages as required by the United States cell phone providers.  It is not an option to remove this feature if the program is used within the US.  If a web-based registration is used, it is suggested that users provide demographic information such as age, gender, and smoking frequency (daily or almost every day, most days, only a few days a week, only on weekends, a few times a month or less) in addition to their mobile phone number and quit date. This information will be useful for assessing the reach of the program, as well as identifying possible need to develop libraries to specific groups. The use of only a mobile phone-based registration system reduces barriers for participant entry into the program but limits the collection of additional data. At bare minimum, quit date must be collected.  At sign up, participants will have the option to choose a quit date up to one month out. Text messages will start up to 14 days before their specified quit date. Users also have the option of changing their quit date at any time if desired. The program can also be modified to provide texts to users who have already quit within the last month.  One possible adaptation of the program is to include a QuitNowTXT ""light"" version. This adaptation would allow individuals who do not have unlimited text messaging capabilities but would still like to receive support to participate by controlling the number of messages they receive. In the light program, users can text any of the programmed keywords without fully opting in to the program. Program Design: The program is designed as a 14-day countdown to quit date, with subsequent six weeks of daily messages. Each day within the program is identified as either a pre-quit date (Q- # days) or a post-quit date (Q+#). If a user opts into the program fewer than 14 days before their quit date, the system will begin sending messages on that day. For example, if they opt in four days prior to their quit date, the system will send a welcome message and recognize that they are at Q-4 (or four days before their quit date), and they will receive the message that everyone else receives four days before their quit date. As the user progresses throughout the program, they will receive messages outlined in the text message library. Throughout the program, users will receive texts that cover a variety of content areas including tips, informational content, motivational messaging, and keyword responses. The frequency of messages increases as the days leading up to and following the user's quit date, with a heavy emphasis on support, efficacy building, and actionable tips. Further away from a user's quit date, the messages will reduce in frequency. If the user says they have started to smoke again, the system will give them the option of continuing the program as planned or starting over and setting a new quit date.  The system is also designed to assess the user's mood, craving level, and smoking status several times during the program. These assessment messages are characterized as MOOD, CRAVE, and STATUS messages. Whenever the system asks for a response from the user, it will send a programmed response based on the user's answer (i.e., if the user responds with MOOD = BAD then they will receive a message customized to that response). These programmed response messages rotate throughout the course of the program. Users can also send the system one of three programmed keywords (CRAVE, MOOD, and SLIP), and the system will send unique, automated responses based on the texted keyword. There are 10 messages for each of the programmed keywords, which rotate on a random basis, decreasing the likelihood the user will get the same response in a row.  After the full six-week program comes to an end, the system will follow up at one, three, and six months to check on the user's smokefree status and offer additional assistance if needed.  Message Types: -'''¢ Tips: Tips provide users with actionable strategies on how to manage cravings and deal with quitting smoking in general. -'''¢ Motivation/encouragement: Motivational messages encourage users to keep going on their smokefree journey despite the difficulty and struggle they may be facing. -'''¢ Information: Informational messages provide users with facts and other salient points about the impact of smoking relevant to their socio-cultural environment. -'''¢ Assessment: The assessment messages are built into the text messaging program and are designed to collect information about the user's experience as they are quitting and provide immediate feedback based on the user's response. Assessment messages fall along three dimensions: mood, craving, and smoking status. -'''¢ Reactive Messaging (Key Words): At any point, the user can initiate an interaction with the program that will return a text message relevant to the user's request for help. In response to the user texting one of the key words, the system will send them unique, automated responses. The key words cover topics relevant to various aspects of cessation.

The TEDS is a continuation of the former Client Data System (CDS) that was originally developed by the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Services Administration (predecessor to SAMHSA) in consultation with representatives of the state substance abuse agencies and appropriate national organizations. TEDS is one of the three components of SAMHSA's Behavioral Health Services Information System (BHSIS, formerly Drug and Alcohol Services Information System (DASIS)). The core of BHSIS is the Inventory of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (I-SATS), formerly known as the National Master Facility Inventory (NMFI). The I-SATS is a continuously-updated comprehensive listing of all known substance abuse treatment facilities. The third component of BHSIS is the National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS), formerly called the Uniform Facility Data Set (UFDS) survey. The N-SSATS is an annual survey of the location, characteristics, and utilization of alcoholism and drug abuse treatment facilities. The N-SSATS/UFDS is available from the SAMHDA Web site. Together, they provide national- and state-level information on the numbers and characteristics of individuals admitted to alcohol and drug treatment and describe the facilities that deliver care to those individuals. TEDS includes facilities that are licensed or certified by the state substance abuse agency to provide substance abuse treatment (or are administratively tracked for other reasons), and that are required by the states to provide TEDS client-level data. While compromising a significant proportion of all admissions to substance abuse treatment, TEDS does not include all such admissions. The scope of admissions included in TEDS is affected by differences in state reporting practices, varying definitions of treatment admission, availability of public funds, and public funding constraints. In 1997, TEDS was estimated to include 83 percent of TEDS-eligible admissions and 67 percent of all known admissions. See the full documentation for additional information.
</p>
<p>The TEDS series was designed to provide annual data on the number and characteristics of persons admitted to public and private substance abuse treatment programs receiving public funding. TEDS includes both Minimum Data Set (MDS) data (required reporting) and Supplemental Data Set (SuDS) data (optional reporting), as reported to state substance abuse agencies by the treatment programs. Additional variables, such as calculated age and census region, are added to the state data. TEDS provides information on service setting, number of prior treatments, primary source of referral, employment status, whether methadone was prescribed in treatment, presence of psychiatric problems, living arrangements, health insurance, substance(s) abused, route of administration, age at first use, pregnancy and veteran status, number of days waiting to enter treatment, and demographic variables.
</p>
<p>The TEDS data collection effort began in 1989 with three-year development grants to states.

Questions include age at first use, as well as lifetime, annual, and past-month usage for the following drugs: alcohol, marijuana, cocaine (including crack), hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants, tobacco, pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives. The survey covers substance abuse treatment history and perceived need for treatment, and includes questions from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders that allow diagnostic criteria to be applied. Respondents were also asked about personal and family income sources and amounts, health care access and coverage, illegal activities and arrest record, problems resulting from the use of drugs, perceptions of risks, and needle-sharing. Demographic data include gender, race, age, ethnicity, educational level, job status, income level, veteran status, household composition, and population density.
</p>
<p>The questionnaire was significantly redesigned in 1994. The 1994 survey for the first time included a rural population supplement to allow separate estimates to be calculated for this population. Other modules have been added each year and retained in subsequent years: mental health and access to care (1994-B); risk/availability of drugs (1996); cigar smoking and new questions on marijuana and cocaine use (1997); question series asked only of respondents aged 12 to 17 (1997); questions on tobacco brand (1999); marijuana purchase questions (2001); prior marijuana and cigarette use, additional questions on drug treatment, adult mental health services, and social environment (2003); and adult and adolescent depression questions derived from the National Comorbidity Survey, Replication (NCS-R) and National Comorbidity Survey, Adolescent (NCS-A) (2004).
</p>
<p>Survey administration and sample design were improved with the implementation of the 1999 survey, and additional improvements were made in 2002. Since 1999, the survey sample has employed a 50-state design with an independent, multistage area probability sample for each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. At this time, the collection mode of the survey changed from personal interviews and self-enumerated answer sheets to using computer-assisted personal interviews and audio computer-assisted self interviews. In 2002, the survey's title was officially changed to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). Participants have been given $30 for participating in the study since then. This has resulted in an increase in participation rates from the years prior to 2002. Also, since 2002 the new population data from the 2000 decennial census has been used for sample weighting procedures. For these reasons, data gathered for 2002 and beyond cannot validly be compared to data prior to 2002.

N-SSATS is one of three components of SAMHSA's Behavioral Health Services Information System (BHSIS, formerly Drug and Alcohol Services Information System (DASIS)) and is designed to provide the mechanism for quantifying the dynamic character and composition ofthe United States substance abuse treatment delivery system. In 1995, SAMHSA created BHSIS (formerly DASIS) to facilitate the integration of its existing treatment service's datasets and to reduce redundancy in data collection and reporting. The other two BHSIS components are the Inventory of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (I-SATS) and the Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS). The I-SATS is a comprehensive listing of all known substance abuse treatment facilities in the United States. The TEDS is a client-level database of individuals admitted to publicly funded substance abuse treatment facilities and is available from the SAMHDA Web site.

<p>Data collected in N-SSATS include topics covering ownership, services offered (assessment and pre-treatment, testing, transitional, ancillary, pharmacotherapies), primary focus (substance abuse, mental health, both, general health, other), hotline operation, methadone/Levo-Alpha Acetyl Methadol (LAAM)/buprenorphine dispensing, counseling and therapeutic approaches, special programs or groups, languages in which treatment is provided, type of treatment provided, number of clients (total and under age 18), number of beds, types of payment accepted, sliding fee scale, and facility accreditation and licensure/certification.
</p>
<p>The data elements and format that make up the core of the N-SSATS were first used in 1976 as part of survey efforts designed to measure the scope and use of drug abuse treatment services in the United States. This core was used throughout the 1970s and 1980s in several different surveys. In 1987 the first administration of the National Drug and Alcoholism Treatment Unit Survey (NDATUS) took place, and then occurred annually from 1989 to 1993. After the creation of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) in 1992, NDATUS was redesigned as the Uniform Facility Data Set (UFDS), which was conducted from 1995 to 1998. In 1999, an abbreviated survey was conducted and the survey was redesigned. The 1999 study is not publicly available. In 2000, the full survey was conducted and renamed the National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS).
</p>
<p>N-SSATS is a point-prevalence survey. It provides information on the substance abuse treatment system and its clients on the reference date. Client counts reported here do not represent annual totals. Rather, N-SSATS provides a ""snapshot"" of substance abuse treatment facilities and clients on an average day. Through 2000, the N-SSATS reference date was October 1. In 2001, SAMHSA changed the reference date to the last business day in March. This change helped increase the timeliness of responses by individual facilities, but resulted in no data being collected for 2001. Therefore, 2002 marked the first year data were collected using the new reference date.

N-SSATS is one of three components of SAMHSA's Behavioral Health Services Information System (BHSIS, formerly Drug and Alcohol Services Information System (DASIS)) and is designed to provide the mechanism for quantifying the dynamic character and composition ofthe United States substance abuse treatment delivery system. In 1995, SAMHSA created BHSIS (formerly DASIS) to facilitate the integration of its existing treatment service's datasets and to reduce redundancy in data collection and reporting. The other two BHSIS components are the Inventory of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (I-SATS) and the Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS). The I-SATS is a comprehensive listing of all known substance abuse treatment facilities in the United States. The TEDS is a client-level database of individuals admitted to publicly funded substance abuse treatment facilities and is available from the SAMHDA Web site. Together, these three BHSIS components provide national- and state-level data on persons receiving alcohol and substance abuse treatment as well as data on the facilities providing the treatment.

<p>The TEDS is a continuation of the former Client Data System (CDS) that was originally developed by the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Services Administration (predecessor to SAMHSA) in consultation with representatives of the state substance abuse agencies and appropriate national organizations. TEDS is one of the three components of SAMHSA's Behavioral Health Services Information System (BHSIS, formerly Drug and Alcohol Services Information System (DASIS)). The core of BHSIS is the Inventory of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (I-SATS), formerly known as the National Master Facility Inventory (NMFI). The I-SATS is a continuously-updated comprehensive listing of all known substance abuse treatment facilities. The third component of BHSIS is the National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS), formerly called the Uniform Facility Data Set (UFDS) survey. The N-SSATS is an annual survey of the location, characteristics, and utilization of alcoholism and drug abuse treatment facilities. The N-SSATS/UFDS is available from the SAMHDA Web site. Together, they provide national- and state-level information on the numbers and characteristics of individuals admitted to alcohol and drug treatment and describe the facilities that deliver care to those individuals. TEDS includes facilities that are licensed or certified by the state substance abuse agency to provide substance abuse treatment (or are administratively tracked for other reasons), and that are required by the states to provide TEDS client-level data.
</p>
<p>The TEDS series was designed to provide annual data on the number and characteristics of persons admitted to and discharged from public and private substance abuse treatment programs receiving public funding. TEDS includes both Minimum Data Set (MDS) data (required reporting) and Supplemental Data Set (SuDS) data (optional reporting), as reported to state substance abuse agencies by the treatment programs. Additional variables, such as calculated age and census region, are added to the state data. TEDS provides information on service setting, number of prior treatments, primary source of referral, employment status, whether methadone was prescribed in treatment, presence of psychiatric problems, living arrangements, health insurance, substance(s) abused, route of administration, age at first use, pregnancy and veteran status, number of days waiting to enter treatment, and demographic variables.
